## 💡 What Makes It Different?

### The Problem
Generic advice like "always overpay" or "never overpay" doesn't work for everyone. Your loan plan, salary, and career path create a unique situation.

### The Solution

- **Teachers (Plan 2)**: See if overpaying makes sense as you progress through pay scales
- **Tech Workers (Plan 5)**: Understand how rapid salary growth affects your loan
- **Public Sector (Any Plan)**: Calculate if you'll benefit from loan write-off
- **High Earners**: Find out if you're paying more interest than necessary

## 📊 How It Works

1. **Enter Your Details** - Loan balance, plan type, and salary
2. **Get Instant Results** - See your monthly payments and total cost
3. **Explore Scenarios** - Compare different overpayment strategies
4. **Make Informed Decisions** - Understand what saves YOU the most money

### Example Results

```
Standard Payments:
→ Monthly: £182
